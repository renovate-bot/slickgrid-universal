### 📢 VueJS Support
> [!NOTE]
> VueJS is now supported via a new [Slickgrid-Vue](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/tree/master/frameworks/slickgrid-vue) Component 🚀. One major difference compare to the other existing framework ports is that this new one is included directly in here under the [`/frameworks`](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/tree/master/frameworks/) folder, eventually all other framework ports will also be moved in here as well (scheduled for our next major version).

### Documentation
📘 [Documentation](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-universal/) website powered by GitBook for version 4.0+ (_or use the [Wikis](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/wiki) for older versions_)

### Live Demo

### Description
This is a monorepo project (using [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Lerna-Lite](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite)) which is regrouping a few packages under a single repository. It was originally requiring SlickGrid as an external dependency, but that was dropped in v4.0, and so it is now a standalone library. The main goal of this project is to create a common repo that includes all Editors, Filters, Extensions and Services that could be used by any frameworks (it is framework agnostic). The original SlickGrid is like an IKEA product that requires assembling everything yourself, however the goal of the project here is to offer an all assembled product that already includes a set of built-in Editors, Filters, Formatters while also offering extra (but optional) packages like OData, GraphQL, Export to Excel ... which SlickGrid simply does not offer by default. The project also provides multiple Themes including Dark Mode. See below for more project details.

### What's the difference with [`6pac/slickgrid`](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid) project?
So you might be wondering, should I use the [`6pac/slickgrid`](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid) or Slickgrid-Universal (and its variances)? The main difference is that the `6pac/slickgrid` is like an unassembled IKEA product where it's very bare bone and unassembled, on the other hand Slickgrid-Universal is an all assembled product. What we mean is that Slickgrid-Universal has many built-in things like Formatters, Editors, Filters, Tree Data, ... that the `6pac/slickgrid` just doesn't have by default. So in the end the `6pac/slickgrid` project is much smaller in size because it's very bare bone but you will have to implement many things by yourself (Sorting/Filtering/Editing/...), if you're looking at creating very basic grids then that might work for you, otherwise Slickgrid-Universal has a more complete set of built-ins with a bit larger download size.

Side note, I am actually a maintainer (`@ghiscoding`) in both projects Slickgrid-Universal and also the `6pac/slickgrid` as well (in fact Slickgrid-Universal was originally using the `6pac/slickgrid` but eventually dropped it to be standalone). The reason is to keep both projects in sync as much as possible with the core files (SlickGrid, SlickDataView and all plugins)... and that's it, I hope it's clear what the differences are, if you need more clarity then feel free to open a new Discussion for more details.

### Why create this monorepo?
Below is a list of reasons as to why this project was created and why it is a monorepo project:
1. originally created to remove duplicated code from these 2 ports
[Angular-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/Angular-Slickgrid) and [Aurelia-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid)
   - prior to this monorepo, these 2 projects had ~90% duplicated code in common which was not very DRY.
   - being a common source makes it a lot easier to maintain by pushing fixes in this common project here.
2. it also decoupled a few Services which are not required in every project (OData, GraphQL, Export to CSV, Export to Excel, Composite Editor, RxJS, ...)
3. and finally it is framework agnostic, it could be implemented in many different frameworks (if you are interested in adding a different framework port, which is not listed in the [table](#available-framework-ports) below (maybe Svelte), then please open a new [Discussion](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/discussions))
   - you can use it in plain JavaScript (ES6) or TypeScript, i.e. we use plain JS (ES6) in our Salesforce environment with LWC (Lightning Web Component)

## Live Demos & Available Framework Ports
The GitHub [live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal) above shows 2 different UI themes (Material Design / Salesforce), but you could also choose the Bootstrap theme which is demoed in other frameworks from links available in the table below. Also note that even though the demos are built with either [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), you could in theory use any other UI libraries. The project tries to be as much agnostic as possible and it does so by providing a large set of CSS/SASS variables which are available to customize however you want.

The Slickgrid-Universal [live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal) is a Vanilla Implementation (which is not associated to any framework) built with [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) (originally [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/)) and is also being used to run all E2E tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing every UI functionalities. The [Vanilla-force-bundle](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/tree/master/packages/vanilla-force-bundle), which extends the [vanilla-bundle](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/tree/master/packages/vanilla-bundle) package, is what we use in our SalesForce implementation (with Lightning Web Component) and it can also be used as a Standalone script (see [zip](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/tree/master/packages/vanilla-force-bundle/dist-grid-bundle-zip) file). These were all the original reasons to create this monorepo library but above all it was to avoid code duplication. Dark Mode is also shown in some of the examples (not all), see [Dark Mode](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-universal/styling/dark-mode) documentation for more infos.

### Fully Tested with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (Unit Tests) - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (E2E Tests)
Slickgrid-Universal has close to **100%** Unit Test Coverage, ~5,000 Vitest unit tests including 800 Cypress E2E tests to cover all [Examples](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal/) and most UI functionalities (each framework implementation also have an additional 800 tests as well), the goal is to test everything and offer peace of mind that pretty much all the code and PR changes are fully tested before releasing anything.

## Installation
**NOTE:** the installation instructions below are **only** required if you want to contribute to this project, if however you just want to download a quick Slickgrid-Universal demo, then I would suggest to take a look at the following repos [Slickgrid-Universal Vite Demo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal-vite-demo) or [Slickgrid-Universal WebPack Demo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal-webpack-demo).

To get started and do development with this monorepo, you will need to clone the repo and follow the steps shown below. You must be at the root of the project in order to run the commands below. This project also requires `pnpm`.

1. pnpm installation

This project uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), you can install pnpm by choosing 1 of these 2 choices:

a. following their [installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

b. or install pnpm via Node [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)
```sh
corepack enable

# optionally update pnpm to latest
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

#### Specific Framework install
For a more targeted install, you could optionally install a specific framework (which avoids installing all frameworks).
Taking Vue for example

```sh
pnpm vue:install
```

> **Note** for frameworks development you will not only require the targeted install but it also requires you to run a `pnpm bundle`

2. Run Dev (Vanilla Implementation)

There is a Vanilla flavour implementation of this monorepo, vanilla means that it is not associated to any framework
and is written in plain TypeScript without being bound to any framework. The implementation is very similar to Angular and Aurelia.
It could be used as a guideline to implement it for other framework ports.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```


3. Build (bundle)

You also need to run a full build in order to run the Vitest unit tests

```bash
pnpm run bundle
```

### Tests
You must go through Installation Steps 1-3 prior to running the Vitest unit tests OR steps 1-2 for Cypress E2E tests.

#### Vitest Unit Tests
To run all unit tests (with Vitest), you can run one of the following commands (make sure that steps 1-3 were executed prior to running this command)
```bash
pnpm run test

# or run Vitest in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch
```

#### Cypress E2E Tests
To run all E2E tests (with Cypress), you can run one of the following commands (make sure that steps 1-2 were executed prior to running this command)
```bash
# will open the Cypress GUI
pnpm run cypress

# or run it in the shell (like a CI/CD would)
pnpm run cypress:ci
```
